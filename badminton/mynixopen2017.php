				<h3>Tournament Rules and Regulations</h3>
				<p>This year we offer the following categories of play: Men's Singles, Men's Doubles 1, Men's Doubles 2, Women's Doubles, Mixed Doubles 1 and Mixed Doubles 2.</p><p>The tournament will be team eliminiation. Every team will first play two random matchup to determine their ranking before heading into two seperate elimination ladders. Half of the teams with the highest accumulated points after the first two matchups will play in our grand prize elimination ladder, whereas the the other half of teams with lower accumulated points will play the consolation elimination ladder. </p><p>

Games will get tough and regular, testing stamina of your players will be tested. And while we leave the strategy of player assignments up to the individual teams, we do wish, and highly recommend, that players are all well represented at the tournament. Meaning that every player gets the chance to play! So choose your assignments carefully. With that said, every player should get a minimum of 3 games if every player is well represented. Note that our tournament does not require that players remain a player of a certain category throughout the tournament. A team may change players in any of their categories. Throughout the tournament, we will only report "Team A, MD1 vs Team 2 MD2", etc. Hence player information is never disclosed. Again, consider your strategy carefully!</p>

				<P> The tournament and respective judges will do the utmost to enforce the official guidelines listed in the <a href="http://www.bwfbadminton.org/file.aspx?id=637751&dl=1" target="_blank"><u>BWF Handbook</u></a>. However specifically for the tournament there are some other considerations:
				<ul><li style="list-style-type:circle!important;margin-left:50px;">All players must arrive in the morning, at a predetermined time, to check-in so that we may verify the presence of players at the competition</li>
				<li style="list-style-type:circle!important;margin-left:50px;">A match can be called 30 minute in advance, all players must report to court in 5 minutes after the game has been called. If the individual does not arrive, they will default (lose) the match.</li>
				<li style="list-style-type:circle!important;margin-left:50px;">Players are allowed 2 minute warm up prior to the beginning of the match. The warmup can be conducted in any manner that the players wish. </li style="list-style-type:circle!important;margin-left:50px;">
				</ul>
				There will be a prize for 1st place, and a prize for first in consolation round.<br>
