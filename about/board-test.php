										of what he sees for future members. Casey was the main organizer of the<br>
										first ever North American Chinese Basketball Association Invitation<br>
										(NACBA) tournament in1988 Montreal under the sponsorship of the Montreal<br>
										Chinese Community United Center and its then president Mr. Leung Tom.<br>
