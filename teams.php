				<h1 id="section1">MMAC Mars</h1>
				<p class="lead">With approximately 30 active players, MARS is MMAC's most competitive team, with players coming from all sorts of basketball playing backgrounds. We have players that have played varsity ball, from high school up to university, to players that have dominated street ball to those that simply want to learn the game. The key to its success as a team is preaching sacrifice, hard work and the value of teamwork. The team is always open to new players that want a platform to improve their skill and to bring their game to the next level. Every week, the players compete in a very competitive local basketball league and in May, they participate in a national tournament.</p>

				<h1 id="section2">MMAC 35+</h1>
				<p class="lead">This team is made up mostly of players that no longer have as much time on their hands due to family and work but still want to stay active. The players, though no longer as athletic as in the past, all have rather high basketball IQ and use that to their advantage. They compete regularly in a league against other Chinese teams.</p>

				<h1 id="section3">MMAC 45+</h1>
				<p class="lead">With approximately 20 members that are all fanatics of the sport, this team is veteran squad of MMAC. The average age of the group is about 55 years old. Four of the members (Casey, Richard, Donald & Arthur) have played together for more than 20 years; their experience and chemistry really does show on the court. Although they are no longer as quick or can jump as high as in the past, they really know how to slow the game down and break down opponents' defense in the half-court. At this point in their basketball career, friendship, fitness and love of the game is what drives them. Winning is always nice, but at the end of the day, this comes second.</p>

				<p class="lead">MMAC Magic strives to be inclusive and to that goal, whenever we can, we assemble a woman's team to represent MMAC and Montreal in the North American Chinese Basketball Tournament. The players are drawn from within the ranks of the woman's training program as well as players from Montreal whose ancestry are of 1/4 or more Chinese descent. The team is coached by Peter Chang who was an assistant coach for the Women's Basketball Team at John Abbott College.</p>

Whether the player plays on their school's varsity, plays at the park, has never played any organized ball at all or anywhere in between, there is place on the roster for them.</p>
